            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>I'm a 23 year old Front-end Software Developer born and raised in Southern California, where I still live today. 
                I've always been pretty nerdy when it came to Tech (Actually I'm nerdy in general but I'm in denial about it), I get huge satisfaction from solving tech-related problems. 
                I went from staying up all night at 10 years old trying to tweak software on my moms old Acer laptop, to now building different websites for fun! I'm certainly not a know-it-all, 
                I'm constantly learning and evolving as a person and a Developer.
                Right now I'm attending Citrus College working on my Computer Science degree, but I plan on transfering to UCLA to complete my Bachelors.
